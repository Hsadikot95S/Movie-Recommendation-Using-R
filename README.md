# Movie Recommendation System: Project using R and Machine learning

## Aim of Project
The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This R project is designed to understand the functioning of a recommendation system. I developed an *Item Based Collaborative Filter*. This helped me gain experience of implementing my R, Data Science, and Machine learning skills in a real-life project.

### Dataset used
I have used the MovieLens Dataset. That data I have used consists of 105339 ratings in the ```ratings.csv``` file, applied over 10329 movies in the ```movies.csv```.

### Essential Libraries
```recommenderlab```, ```ggplot2```, ```data.table``` and ```reshape2```.
